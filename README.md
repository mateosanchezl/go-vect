# go-vect

**A lightweight, local embedding and vector search engine written from scratch in Go.**

## Motivations

In an effort to learn Go and how vector databases work under the hood, I've been building `go-vect` as a fun side project in my spare time.

My aim with this project was never to build the next Pinecone. Instead, it is to:

- Build a semantic search playground
- Implement a complete embedding pipeline with local inference
- All while using as few external dependencies as possible
